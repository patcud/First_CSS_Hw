    <p>
        Scrambled eggs are one of the most popular methods of cooking eggs for breakfast. 
        The eggs are first whisked together and then gently cooked in a pan while being pushed 
        into soft folds or stirred.

    <h2>HOW TO MAKE</h2>
    <p>
        Whisk eggs together in a bowl. Melt a bit of butter in a non-stick or cast iron skillet 
        over medium-low heat. Pour in the eggs. As they begin to set, use a silicone spatula to 
        gently push and fold the eggs to create soft curds.
