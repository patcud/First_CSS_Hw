    <p>
        Fried eggs are cooked in a skillet on one or both sides. There are four basic styles of 
        fried eggs: sunny side up, over easy, over medium and over well.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Sunny Side Up:</strong> 
                    egg is fried on one side with the yolk facing up. The whites are firm and the yolk is still runny.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Over Easy:</strong> 
                    The egg is flipped and cooked briefly on the other side so that the yolk is still runny.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Over Medium:</strong> 
                    The egg is flipped and cooked until the yolk is just slightly runny.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Over Well (or Over Hard):</strong> 
                    The egg is flipped and cooked until the yolk is hard.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>HOW TO MAKE</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Sunny Side Up:</strong>
        Heat some butter or oil in a non-stick or cast iron skillet over 
        medium heat. Crack the egg and carefully place it in the pan. Let 
        the egg cook until the whites are firm but the yolk is still runny 
        (about 3-4 minutes).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Over Easy, Medium and Well:</strong>
        Flip the sunny side up egg over and cook for an additional 10-30 seconds 
        on the other side for over easy, 30-60 seconds for over medium, or 1-2 minutes 
        for over well eggs.
