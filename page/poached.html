        A poached egg is an egg cooked in barely simmering water, without its shell. It has firm whites 
        on the outside and a soft and oozy yolk on the inside. Poached eggs might seem fancy or 
        intimidating but they are actually quite simple to make at home.

    <h2>HOW TO MAKE</h2>
    <p>
        Bring a pot of water to a bare simmer. Crack the egg into a small fine mesh sieve set over a bowl 
        to strain out any watery bits of egg white (this prevents those wispy pieces when cooking). 
        Transfer the egg to a ramekin or small bowl and gently slide the egg into the water. Cook for 3-4 minutes, 
        scoop out with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel.
