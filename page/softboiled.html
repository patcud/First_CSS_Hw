    <p>
        A soft boiled egg is a whole egg (in its shell) that has been boiled until the whites
        are set but the yolk still has a runny or jammy consistency.
    </p>
    <h2>HOW TO MAKE</h2>
    <p>
        Bring a pot of water to a gentle boil. Gently lower in eggs and set a timer for 6-7 minutes. 
        Remove eggs and run under cold water for a few seconds until cool enough to handle. Serve while 
        still warm.
