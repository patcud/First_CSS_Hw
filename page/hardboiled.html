    <p>
        A hard boiled egg is a whole egg (in its shell) that has been boiled until both the yolk 
        and whites are fully cooked and firm. They are super easy to make and can be used in 
        so many ways!
    </p>
    <h2>HOW TO MAKE</h2>
    <p>
        Bring a pot of water to a gentle boil. Gently lower in eggs and set a timer for 12 minutes. 
        Remove eggs to an ice water bath to stop the cooking process and to cool completely before 
        peeling.
